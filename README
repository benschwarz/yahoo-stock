A Yahoo "API Wrapper"

There is no wrapper for Yahoo's stocks interface, 
here I provided the most grass roots experience possible.

It will get the job done for my purpose and should be fairly
easy to extend. Specs are provided. 


Usage is as follows:

require 'rubygems'
require 'yahoo-stock'
@stock = Yahoo::Stock.new("MGR.AX")
@stock.last_trade => 4.10


If you want additional properties (there is currently only 'last_trade')
Fork the repo, add your own and send it back in. Now thats community!
